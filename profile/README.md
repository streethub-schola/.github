**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

** Schola is an open source Education Management Portal as a Service intended to contribute to the way Educational Institutional Owners administer and run their schools in Nigeria.
Currently in its development stage, this project when completed will serve as a tool to solve most of the current challenges in the Edu space.

As the team progresses, we will furnish you with more detailed information about our workflows, but for now, kindly give us a star to encourage our team to do more.
